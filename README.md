# create-framework-package

## Installation

Just install generator package.

```bash
npm install -g generator-create-framework-package
```

Then generate your framework project from template.

```bash
npx yo create-framework-package
```

If you don't want to use npx you can install `yo` globally.

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

After that you can create package similar way.

```bash
yo create-framework-package
```

All is that.
